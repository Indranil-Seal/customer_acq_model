Introduction
Customer acquisition cost (CAC) is a critical metric for businesses to understand the cost-effectiveness of their marketing and sales efforts. This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict and analyze the cost of acquiring customers based on historical data.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is stored in the data/ directory. It includes various features such as demographics, marketing channels, campaign data, and acquisition costs. The dataset is not included in this repository due to confidentiality reasons but can be obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramjasmaurya/medias-cost-prediction-in-foodmart.
